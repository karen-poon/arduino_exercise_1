# Arduino Exercise 1

This program detects key presses, and show the count on an LCD screen. When you are pressing on a key, the LED light will be on and a 'beep' sound will be produced. The count increments/decrements depending on which key you pressed.

This is a good exercise to practice coding with LCD screens and debounce of keys.

## Setup
To run this program properly, you have to install the following library: LiquidCrystal_I2C

There are lots of libraries for LCDs, but this is the one I used:

(Note: code might not work if another LCD library is installed)
